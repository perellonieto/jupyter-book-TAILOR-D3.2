# Edge Computing (Sustainability)

*Edge computing* (or *fog computing*) is a distributed computing paradigm in which processing and data storage are brought closer to the data sources. This should increase response times while also conserving bandwidth. Rather than referring to a single technology, the phrase refers to an architecture.
