# Properties of Privacy Models

<!--
- **Safety under post-processing**: any function applied over the
   output of a differentially-private function and that does not input
   additional (unprotected) individual data also satisfies
   differential privacy.
- **Self-Composability**: the composition of two functions that
  independently satisfy the same differential privacy model also
  satisfies the model at the cost of a degradation of the guarantees.
- **Convexity**: a random choice between two differentially private
  function also satisfies differential privacy.
