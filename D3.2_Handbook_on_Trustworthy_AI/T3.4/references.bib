The W3C Provenance Working Group has recently released the PROV family of specifications for provenance on the Web. While provenance focuses on what is executed, it is important in science to publish the general methods that describe scientific processes at a more abstract and general level. In this paper, we propose P-PLAN, an extension of PROV to represent plans that guid-ed the execution and their correspondence to provenance records that describe the execution itself. We motivate and discuss the use of P-PLAN and PROV to publish scientific workflows as Linked Data.}

ABSTRACT = {Traceability is considered a key requirement for trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI), related to the need to maintain a complete account of the provenance of data, processes, and artifacts involved in the production of an AI model. Traceability in AI shares part of its scope with general purpose recommendations for provenance as W3C PROV, and it is also supported to different extents by specific tools used by practitioners as part of their efforts in making data analytic processes reproducible or repeatable. Here, we review relevant tools, practices, and data models for traceability in their connection to building AI models and systems. We also propose some minimal requirements to consider a model traceable according to the assessment list of the High-Level Expert Group on AI. Our review shows how, although a good number of reproducibility tools are available, a common approach is currently lacking, together with the need for shared semantics. Besides, we have detected that some tools have either not achieved full maturity, or are already falling into obsolescence or in a state of near abandonment by its developers, which might compromise the reproducibility of the research trusted to them.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, machine learning projects have become more and more relevant to various real-world use cases. The success of complex Neural Network models depends upon many factors, as the requirement for structured and machine learning-centric project development management arises. Due to the multitude of tools available for different operational phases, responsibilities and requirements become more and more unclear. In this work, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) technologies and tools for every part of the overall project pipeline, as well as involved roles, are examined and clearly defined. With the focus on the inter-connectivity of specific tools and comparison by well-selected requirements of MLOps, model performance, input data, and system quality metrics are briefly discussed. By identifying aspects of machine learning, which can be reused from project to project, open-source tools which help in specific parts of the pipeline, and possible combinations, an overview of support in MLOps is given. Deep learning has revolutionized the field of Image processing, and building an automated machine learning workflow for object detection is of great interest for many organizations. For this, a simple MLOps workflow for object detection with images is portrayed.},
